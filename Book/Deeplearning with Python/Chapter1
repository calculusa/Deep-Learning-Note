 3.2 Loss function
 To control something, first you need to be able to observe it. To control the output of
 a neural network, you need to be able to measure how far this output is from what you
 expected. This is the job of the loss function of the network, also called the objective
 function. The loss function takes the predictions of the network and the true target
 (what you wanted the network to output) and computes a distance score, capturing
 how well the network has done on this specific example
