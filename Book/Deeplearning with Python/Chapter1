 3.2 Loss function
 To control something, first you need to be able to observe it. To control the output of
 a neural network, you need to be able to measure how far this output is from what you
 expected. This is the job of the loss function of the network, also called the objective
 function. The loss function takes the predictions of the network and the true target
 (what you wanted the network to output) and computes a distance score, capturing
 how well the network has done on this specific example

 For our purposes, deep learning is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data.
 3.4 What makes deep learning different
 The primary reason deep learning took off so quickly is that it offered better performance
 on many problems. But thatâ€™s not the only reason. Deep learning also makes problem-solving much easier, 
 because it completely automates what used to be the most crucial step in a machine-learning workflow: feature engineering.
