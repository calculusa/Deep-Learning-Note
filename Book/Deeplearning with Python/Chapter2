Chapter2 Before we begin: the mathematical building blocks of neural networks

2.1 A first look at a neural network
 A loss function
 An optimizer
 Metrics to monitor during training and testing

2.2 Data representations for neural networks
 2.2.1 Scalars (0D tensors)
 2.2.2 Vectors (1D tensors)
 2.2.3 Matrices (2D tensors)
 2.2.4 3D tensors and higher-dimensional tensors
 2.2.5 Key attributes
  A tensor is defined by three key attributes:
   Number of axes (rank)
   Shape
   Data type
 2.2.6 Manipulating tensors in Numpy 
 2.2.7 The notion of data batches
